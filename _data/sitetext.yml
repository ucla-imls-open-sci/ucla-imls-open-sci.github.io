          Led by the UCLA Library Data Science Center, this project will incentivize two sequential one year cohorts of authors to develop and refine lessons through summer workshops.
          As part of this project, the UCLA Library Data Science Center is pleased to announce the call for proposals to develop lessons for librarians focused on open science methods and principles. **NOW DUE 2/29/2024**

These curricula will be published online in an unrestricted and freely available manner for reuse and remixing. These lesson modules will be developed and supported through two virtual summer workshops, and we will use feedback from lesson piloting to test the learning objectives with librarian learners."
