    body: "The University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) Library, with funding from the Institute of Museum and Library Services as part of the Laura Bush 21st Century Librarian Program, aims to create 14 lessons that invite librarians to increase their aptitudes in the principles and practices of Open Science.
          Led by the UCLA Library Data Science Center, this project will incentivize two sequential one year cohorts of authors to develop and refine lessons through summer workshops.
          As part of this project, the UCLA Library Data Science Center is pleased to announce the call for proposals to develop lessons for librarians focused on open science methods and principles.

We aim to fund projects with high potential for **subsequent impact on the open science community**. We invite proposals based on **diverse intellectual approaches** and **personal backgrounds** to achieve these ends. "

      - title: "Program Goals"
        desc: "This program will result in 14 open science course modules for librarians at any career stage, with seven lesson proposals selected each year of the grant. These curricula will be published online in an unrestricted and freely available manner for reuse and remixing. These lesson modules will be developed and supported through two virtual summer workshops, and we will use feedback from lesson piloting to test the learning objectives with librarian learners."
