# Contributing to Lessons for Librarians in Open Science

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the Lessons for Librarians in Open Science project! This project is built by and for the library community, and we welcome contributions of all kinds - especially from those who teach, pilot, and engage with our lessons.

By contributing to this project, you are agreeing that The Carpentries and UCLA may redistribute your work under [our license](LICENSE.txt). You also agree to abide by our [contributor code of conduct](#code-of-conduct).

## Who We're Looking For

We especially value contributions from:

- **Librarians and information professionals** who work with researchers and students
- **Instructors** who have experience teaching technical workshops or information literacy
- **Open science practitioners** who can provide real-world context and examples
- **Learners** who have taken or are taking these lessons and can offer fresh perspectives
- **Developers and designers** who can help improve the technical infrastructure

You don't need to be a Git expert or a programmer to contribute. We welcome contributions at all technical levels!

## Ways to Contribute

### 🎯 Priority: Pilot Our Lessons!

**The most valuable contribution you can make is to teach one of our lessons.** We are actively seeking instructors to pilot our curriculum. When you pilot a lesson, you:

- Gain hands-on experience with open science tools and methods
- Help us identify areas that need clarification or improvement
- Provide authentic feedback about pacing, difficulty, and learner comprehension
- Contribute to the evidence base for lesson effectiveness

**How to get started with piloting:**

1. **Express Interest**: [Fill out our Pilot Interest form](https://github.com/ucla-imls-open-sci/ucla-imls-open-sci.github.io/issues/new?template=pilot-interest.yml) or open a GitHub issue with the "pilot" label
2. **Choose a Lesson**: Browse our [lesson catalog](https://ucla-imls-open-sci.info) and select one that fits your audience and expertise
3. **Prepare**: Review the lesson materials, instructor notes, and setup instructions
4. **Teach**: Deliver the lesson to your learners (in-person, hybrid, or virtual)
5. **Report Back**: Share your experience using our [Pilot Report template](#pilot-report-template) (see below)

We provide support for pilots including:
- Access to lesson authors for questions
- Community of practice discussions with other pilots
- Recognition and co-authorship credit for substantial contributions

### 💬 Share Your Teaching Experience

Have you already taught one of our lessons or a related topic? We'd love to hear about it!

- **File an issue** describing what worked well and what could be improved
- **Share your adaptations** - Did you modify the lesson for your context? Tell us how!
- **Report timing issues** - Did certain sections take longer or shorter than expected?
- **Identify confusing sections** - Where did learners get stuck or ask for clarification?

### 🐛 Report Issues and Bugs

If you find errors, broken links, outdated information, or technical problems:

1. **Check existing issues** to see if it's already been reported
2. **Open a new issue** with a clear title and description
3. **Include details**: Which lesson? What page or section? What did you expect vs. what happened?
4. **Screenshots help!** If it's a visual issue, include a screenshot

You can report issues even if you don't know how to fix them. Fresh eyes often catch things that maintainers miss!

### ✏️ Suggest Improvements

We welcome suggestions for:

- **Content clarifications** - Better explanations, additional examples, or helpful diagrams
- **Accessibility improvements** - Making lessons more accessible to diverse learners
- **Updated resources** - New tools, updated links, or current examples
- **Cultural context** - Examples that resonate with diverse geographic and institutional contexts
- **Additional exercises** - Practice opportunities that reinforce learning objectives

You can suggest improvements by:
- Opening a GitHub issue with the "enhancement" label
- Emailing the project team (see [README.md](README.md) for contact info)
- Participating in community discussions

### 🔧 Submit Pull Requests

If you're comfortable with Git and GitHub, you can contribute directly:

1. **Fork** this repository to your GitHub account
2. **Clone** your fork to your local machine
3. **Create a branch** for your changes: `git checkout -b descriptive-branch-name`
4. **Make your changes** following our [style guide](#style-guide)
5. **Test locally** using `npm run dev` to preview your changes
6. **Commit** with clear, descriptive messages
7. **Push** to your fork: `git push origin descriptive-branch-name`
8. **Open a Pull Request** from your fork to our `main` branch

In your pull request description, please:
- Explain what you changed and why
- Reference any related issues (e.g., "Fixes #123")
- Describe how you tested your changes

### 🌍 Translate Lessons

We welcome efforts to make these materials accessible in languages other than English. If you're interested in translating a lesson:

1. Open an issue to let us know which lesson and language
2. We'll help coordinate to avoid duplication of effort
3. Follow translation best practices (we can provide guidance)
4. Consider cultural adaptation, not just literal translation

### 📚 Share How You're Using Our Materials

We'd love to know how our lessons are being used! Share with us:

- Blog posts about your teaching experience
- Adaptations for specific audiences or contexts
- Integration with other curricula or programs
- Success stories from learners

Tag us or open an issue to share your story!

## What We're Not Looking For

To keep our lessons focused and maintainable, we generally don't accept:

- **Substantial new content** that extends beyond current learning objectives (though we're open to new lesson proposals!)
- **Tools or platforms** that only work on one operating system (we support Windows, macOS, and Linux)
- **Commercial or proprietary tools** without open-source alternatives
- **Significant scope changes** without prior discussion with maintainers

If you're unsure whether your contribution fits, please open an issue to discuss it before investing significant time!

### Writing Style

- **Use inclusive language** - Avoid gendered pronouns; use "they/them" or rephrase
