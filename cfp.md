## Program Overview 

The University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) Library, with funding from the Institute of Museum and Library Services as part of the Laura Bush 21st Century Librarian Program, aims to create 14 lessons that invite librarians to increase their aptitudes in the principles and practices of Open Science. Led by the UCLA Library Data Science Center, this project will incentivize two sequential one year cohorts of authors to develop and refine lessons through summer workshops. As part of this project, the UCLA Library Data Science Center is pleased to announce the call for proposals to develop lessons for librarians focused on open science methods and principles. 

This project seeks to support continued skills development for librarians in open science by creating a librarian-focused curriculum for open science. When librarians increase their aptitudes in the principles and practices of open science, they can provide instruction to researchers and better support faculty by advocating and teaching open and transparent techniques. In the summer workshops, we will utilize [Carpentries Curriculum Development guidelines](https://cdh.carpentries.org/) and the [Collaborative Lesson Development Training program](https://carpentries.github.io/lesson-development-training/) to provide a framework for curriculum development. 

## Program Goals

This program will result in 14 open science course modules for librarians at any career stage, with seven lesson proposals selected each year of the grant. These curricula will be published online in an unrestricted and freely available manner for reuse and remixing. These lesson modules will be developed and supported through two virtual summer workshops, and we will use feedback from lesson piloting to test the learning objectives with librarian learners.

## Lesson Proposal Parameters

We are seeking lesson proposals intended for use in synchronous instruction settings. Lesson proposals should support both in-person and virtual environments. The completed lesson is expected to be 90 minutes to 3 hours long. We prefer submissions that use open resources, such as open-source tools and software, and resources that are broadly accessible to all.

Proposals on the following topics are encouraged, but applicants should feel free to propose lessons that are related to open science: 

* What is/Why do Open Science? ([FAIR](https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/), Guidance/Recommendations)
* Paths to Open Science, Stories, Examples, Use Cases
* Diverse, Equitable, Inclusive Communities (Fostering, Maintaining)
* Writing Open Science (Peer Review Process, Audiences, Forms)
* Linking Open Science, Search & Discovery Systems (Databases/Indexing, PIDs, Semantic Web)
* Team Science (Project Management, Versioning Systems)
* Data/Software Management (Best Practices/Standards, Tidy/Quality/Validating/Testing, Sharing/Publishing)
* Data Science, Modeling, Machine Learning, and AI-Ready Data (Standards, Good Practices)
* Open Science in the Cloud (Remote Computing, Virtual Environments, Automation)
* Notebook Science (Reproducibility, Workflows)
* Analysis, Visualization, and Accessibility
* Responsible Conduct of Research (Ethics, Scientific Integrity, AI/ML)
* Community Science (Storytelling, Communicating Science to the Public)
* Open and FAIR Hardware (Making)

## Eligibility

We will accept applications from one applicant or several applicants as a group. No specific professional qualifications are required.

## Proposal Details

The proposal should include lesson justification, a brief statement on your intended lesson audience, learning objectives, and a description of the lesson content. The proposal should be 500-700 words, in Arial font, size 12, and with a line spacing of 1.5. References and other supporting materials can be added. All documents need to be in one pdf. Please submit your proposal [here](https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/63JTJSQ). 

## Dates 

The deadline for submission is January 31st, 2023. Awards will be announced by April 30th, 2023. 

## Funding and Support

We will provide each award recipient or group with $5,000 for developing a lesson (how the recipient(s) receive the award depends on each institution). We will also offer two rounds of summer workshops (2023 and 2024) to teach the awarded recipients the necessary skills to build lessons. The UCLA Data Science Center will provide technical support for publishing the developed lessons.

### Eligibility for Financial Portion of Award

* University of California applicants need to reach out to the program officers [here](datascience+imls@ucla.edu) for rules regarding UC compensation. 
* Compensation restrictions may apply depending on an individual’s employment status and employer.
