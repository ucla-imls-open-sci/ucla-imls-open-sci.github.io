</div>


We have extended the application deadline to February 29th, 2024, for proposals in [Lessons for Librarians in Open Science Principles and Methods 2024](https://ucla-imls-open-sci.info/cfp). We changed the deadline to give all interested parties more time to prepare and submit their proposals.

We seek lesson proposals for synchronous instruction in both in-person and virtual settings. Each completed lesson should be 90 minutes to 3 hours in duration. We strongly prefer proposals utilizing open resources, such as open-source tools and software, which are accessible to all. 

Proposals on the following topics are encouraged, but applicants should feel free to propose lessons that are related to open science:

We are seeking lesson proposals intended for use in synchronous instruction settings. Lesson proposals should support both in-person and virtual environments. The completed lesson is expected to be 90 minutes to 3 hours long. We prefer submissions that use open resources, such as open-source tools and software, and resources that are broadly accessible to all.

Proposals on the following topics are encouraged, but applicants should feel free to propose lessons that are related to open science: 

* What is/Why do Open Science? ([FAIR](https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/), Guidance/Recommendations)
* Paths to Open Science, Stories, Examples, Use Cases
* Diverse, Equitable, Inclusive Communities (Fostering, Maintaining)
* Writing Open Science (Peer Review Process, Audiences, Forms)
* Linking Open Science, Search & Discovery Systems (Databases/Indexing, PIDs, Semantic Web)
* Team Science (Project Management, Versioning Systems)
* Data/Software Management (Best Practices/Standards, Tidy/Quality/Validating/Testing, Sharing/Publishing)
* Data Science, Modeling, Machine Learning, and AI-Ready Data (Standards, Good Practices)
* Open Science in the Cloud (Remote Computing, Virtual Environments, Automation)
* Notebook Science (Reproducibility, Workflows)
* Analysis, Visualization, and Accessibility
* Responsible Conduct of Research (Ethics, Scientific Integrity, AI/ML)
* Community Science (Storytelling, Communicating Science to the Public)
* Open and FAIR Hardware (Making)

Award recipients or groups will receive $5,000 for developing a lesson, with specific disbursement details dependent on their institution. Additionally, we will offer summer workshops in 2024 to equip awardees with the necessary skills for lesson development. The UCLA Library Data Science Center will provide technical support for publishing these lessons.
