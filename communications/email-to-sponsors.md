Subject: Project Update: IMLS Open Science Lessons Migration Complete & Site Launch

Dear Virginia, Athena, and Todd,

I am writing to share that we have reached a major milestone in the "Lessons for Librarians in Open Science Principles and Methods" project. 

I’m pleased to report that we have over-delivered on our grant requirements, producing 15 lessons when the project originally called for 14. We have also successfully migrated the site to a modern, dynamic portal at https://ucla-imls-open-sci.info, which will allow us to track and promote the curriculum as it matures.

Our ultimate goal is to move these lessons into either a formal Carpentries curriculum or the Carpentries Incubator, depending on the level of community engagement we see during the upcoming piloting phase.

**Key highlights of this final phase include:**
*   **Expanded Curriculum:** 15 high-quality open science lessons for librarians.
*   **The Portal:** A long-term home to manage metadata and citations automatically.
*   **Archival Record:** We have minted a permanent DOI for the project via Zenodo (https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.18055759), ensuring the grant outputs are citable and preserved.
*   **Sustainability & Piloting:** We are beginning a public "Pilot Call" to the Carpentries community. The Library Carpentry Curriculum Advisory Committee (LC-CAC) is helping us facilitate this phase and will assist in determining the final disposition of these lessons.

Thank you for your leadership and support throughout the project. It has been a privilege to bring this grant to such a successful close.

Best regards,

Tim Dennis
Program Director
