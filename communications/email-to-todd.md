Subject: Project Update: IMLS Open Science Lessons Migration Complete & Site Launch

Dear Todd,

I am writing to share that we have reached a major milestone in the "Lessons for Librarians in Open Science Principles and Methods" project. 

The transition of our project infrastructure is now complete. We have successfully migrated the site to a modern framework (Astro v5), which has allowed us to create a centralized curriculum hub. You can view the live site here: https://ucla-imls-open-sci.info

Key highlights of this final phase include:
*   Dynamic Lesson Hub: Each of the 15 lessons now has a dedicated, automated page that includes live metadata and lesson-specific citation information.
*   Enhanced Metadata: We’ve generated CITATION.cff files for all lesson repositories, ensuring that authors receive proper credit as these materials are adopted by the community.
*   Piloting Phase: We are beginning a public "Pilot Call" to the Carpentries community to move these lessons from Alpha to Beta.

The Library Carpentry Curriculum Advisory Committee (LC-CAC) is helping us facilitate this piloting phase and will assist in determining the ultimate disposition of these lessons.

Thank you for your leadership and support throughout the inception and execution of this grant. It has been a privilege to bring this project to a successful close.

Best regards,

Tim
