Subject: IMLS Open Science Project: Site Launch & Final Update

Dear Review Committee Members,

I am writing to share the final results of the project you helped shape. The "Lessons for Librarians in Open Science" curriculum hub is now live at: https://ucla-imls-open-sci.info

As you review the site, you will see the 15 lessons that were selected and developed thanks to your review of the proposals. We have successfully migrated the project to a sustainable static site framework (Astro v5), ensuring these resources remain available and easy to maintain. Each lesson now has a dedicated page with automated citations and author profiles.

**How you can help:**
We are now moving into the "Pilot Call" phase to field-test these lessons with the broader community. The Library Carpentry Curriculum Advisory Committee (LC-CAC) is helping us facilitate this process to move lessons from Alpha to Beta. 

I would appreciate any help you can provide in promoting these lessons within your networks. If you know of librarians or groups who might be interested in piloting these materials, please share the site link with them, or direct them to our [Pilot Interest tracker](https://github.com/ucla-imls-open-sci/ucla-imls-open-sci.github.io/issues/new?template=pilot-interest.yml).

Thank you again for your time and expertise in reviewing the proposals and helping guide the direction of this curriculum. This resource exists because of your early work and contributions.

Best regards,

Tim Dennis
Program Director
