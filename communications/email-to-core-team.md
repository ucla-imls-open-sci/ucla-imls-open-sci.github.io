Subject: Core Team Update: IMLS Grant Completion & Next Steps

Hi Team (Todd, Chris, Elizabeth, Zhiyuan, Eric, Lawrence, and Madeline),

I’m happy to share that we have officially completed our work on the IMLS Open Science Lessons grant. 

We over-delivered on our core promise, producing 15 lessons when the grant called for 14. We’ve also transitioned the project website into a curriculum portal at https://ucla-imls-open-sci.info. This hub allows us to track lesson progress and promote the next phase of the project. Ultimately, we plan to move these lessons into either an official Carpentries curriculum or the Carpentries Incubator, depending on community engagement and piloting results.

**Project DOI & Credit:**
To recognize the work of this core team, I have included you all in the official project DOI: https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.18055759. I used the CRediT taxonomy to describe everyone’s specific roles. Please take a look and let me know if you want me to change anything.

**What we’ve achieved together:**
*   **15 Developed Lessons:** Surpassing our original target of 14.
*   **Curriculum Portal:** A centralized hub to track and promote lesson development.
*   **Automation:** Lesson pages now pull live metadata and generate citations automatically.

**Next Steps: Promoting the Pilots**
The next step is to get these lessons field-tested. I am launching a public "Pilot Call" to the Carpentries community to move the lessons from Alpha to Beta. 

**How you can help:** 
Any promotion you can do within your own networks to encourage librarians to pilot these lessons would be great. You can direct them to our [Pilot Interest issue template](https://github.com/ucla-imls-open-sci/ucla-imls-open-sci.github.io/issues/new?template=pilot-interest.yml) if they'd like to sign up. 

Thank you again for your dedication. This project wouldn't have been possible without this team's work and guidance.

Best,

Tim
