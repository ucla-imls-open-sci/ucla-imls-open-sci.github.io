Subject: IMLS Grant Completion: Our Open Science Lessons are live!

Hey All,

I’m excited to share that we have officially completed our deliverables and final reporting for the IMLS "Lessons for Librarians in Open Science" grant. 

The new curriculum portal is now live: https://ucla-imls-open-sci.info

As part of the project’s final wrap-up, we’ve made several enhancements to showcase your work:
*   **Individual Lesson Pages:** Each lesson now has a dedicated page featuring its abstract, learning objectives, and author bios.
*   **Automated Citations:** We have added dynamic APA and BibTeX citation blocks to lesson pages and generated CITATION.cff files for your repositories to ensure you receive proper credit.
*   **Author Profiles:** We’ve created individual profile pages for all authors to highlight your expertise.

**Lesson Lifecycle & Next Steps:**
We know that our lessons are at different stages of maturity, ranging from **Pre-Alpha** (still in development) to **Alpha** (taught by authors) and **Beta** (ready for community piloting). We have labeled the current status of each lesson on the site to reflect this.

The Library Carpentry Curriculum Advisory Committee (LC-CAC) will be helping us steward these lessons forward. 
1.  **Piloting & Promotion:** We are launching a "Pilot Call" blog post to the Carpentries community soon. **We would appreciate any help you can provide in promoting this call within your own networks** once it is live to help move the Alpha lessons toward Beta.
2.  **Continued Development:** For lessons in Pre-Alpha, there is no pressure! The site serves as a home for your work as it continues to evolve.

**A Small Request:**
Please take a moment to **review your lesson and author profile** on the site. Specifically:
*   Does the lesson metadata and link look correct?
*   Is the lifecycle stage we assigned (Pre-Alpha/Alpha/Beta) accurate for the current state of your lesson?
*   Do you have any quick corrections for your bio or profile?

If you see anything that needs a fix, just let me know.

Thank you again for your incredible contributions. This resource exists because of your expertise and hard work.

Best,

Tim
