We are thrilled to announce the launch of our redesigned website!

This project has evolved from a grant announcement into a comprehensive **Open Science Education Hub** for librarians. Our new site reflects this shift with features designed to help you find, teach, and contribute to the curriculum.

### What's New?

*   **Curated Pathways**: Not sure where to start? Our homepage now guides you based on your role (Liaison, Data Steward, Community Builder).
*   **Lesson Detail Pages**: Every lesson now has a dedicated page with learning objectives, instructor notes, and licensing info.
*   **Author Profiles**: Meet the incredible community of librarians who authored these materials.
*   **External Resources**: We've integrated key resources like the **ACRL Open Science Cookbook** and **NASA TOPS** directly into our directory.

### Getting Involved

The most exciting part of this launch is the new **Pilot Program**. If you are interested in teaching any of our Beta lessons at your institution, simply click the "Express Interest in Piloting" button on any lesson page.
