We are excited to unveil a major redesign and technical overhaul of the **Open Science for Librarians** website. 

This project has evolved significantly since its inception as an IMLS grant announcement. Today, it stands as a comprehensive **Educational Hub** designed to meet librarians and information professionals at every stage of their Open Science journey—from conceptual foundations to technical mastery and classroom instruction.

### Technical Modernization

We have migrated the entire platform from Jekyll to **Astro**. This shift provides:
*   **Blistering Performance**: Zero-JavaScript by default for faster load times.
*   **Strict Accessibility**: Every component has been audited to meet **WCAG 2.1 Level AA** standards, ensuring our curriculum is inclusive for all.
*   **Academic Citability**: We've integrated a dedicated **Citation Tool** powered by `CITATION.cff`, making it easier than ever for researchers to credit our contributors.

### User-Centered Discovery

The new design moves away from simple lists and focuses on **scaffolded learning**:
*   **Curated Pathways**: Our new homepage features journey-based pathways—"Start with Basics," "Browse Curriculum," and "Find Tools"—to guide users based on their immediate needs.
*   **Unified Resource Grid**: We've integrated prestigious external references like the **ACRL Open Science Cookbook**, **NASA TOPS**, and **UNESCO Recommendations** alongside our own IMLS-funded lessons.
*   **Real-Time Filtering**: A powerful new search and thematic filtering system allows you to find resources by topic (e.g., Data Management, Reproducibility, Technical Skills) instantly.

### Evidence of Impact

We are committed to transparency and community growth. Each lesson page now features:
*   **Detailed Spec Sheets**: At-a-glance info on lesson duration, difficulty level, and licensing (CC-BY 4.0).
*   **Workshop History**: A living record of where these lessons have been piloted, including major milestones like presentations at **IASSIST** and articles accepted in **JeSLIB**.
*   **Governance Transparency**: Clear badges for lessons formally adopted by **Library Carpentry** and notes on their status within the peer-review lifecycle.

### Help Us Grow

The core of this project is the community. We've introduced a streamlined **Pilot Interest** workflow. If you are interested in teaching a lesson at your institution, you can now "Express Interest" directly from any lesson page via a structured GitHub form.

Explore the new hub and join us in building a more open and reproducible future for librarianship.
