We are thrilled to announce the winners of the <a href="https://ucla-imls-open-sci.info/cfp">Lessons for Librarians in Open Science Principles and Methods</a> in 2023. It is a 2-year pioneering initiative led by the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) Library and funded by the Institute of Museum and Library Services through the Laura Bush 21st Century Librarian Program. We will have another call in late 2023, and winners coming in 2024. This year,  after a rigorous evaluation process, we have selected six outstanding groups of applicants to develop and refine lessons that will empower librarians in the principles and practices of Open Science.

**Congratulations to the Winning Groups:**

- **Research Community Outreach with Open Science Team Agreements**
    - Samantha Teplitzky; Open Science Librarian; University of California, Berkeley
    - Ariel Deardorff; Director of Data Science and Open Scholarship; University of California, San Francisco
    - Samantha Wilairat; Research Communications Librarian; Stanford University

- **Open Science Hardware: an Introduction for Librarians**
    - Julieta Arancio; Guest and Associate Researcher; Technical University Berlin, Germany;

- **A Path to Open, Inclusive, and Collaborative Science for Librarians**
    - Irene Vazano; Information Technology Librarian; MetaDocencia
    - Jessica Formoso; Researcher and Assistant Professor; MetaDocencia | University of Buenos Aires

- **Data Management (and Sharing) Plans for Librarians 101**
    - Lena Bohman; Data Management and Research Impact Librarian; Zucker School of Medicine at Hofstra/Northwell
    - Marla Hertz; Research Data Management Librarian; University of Alabama at Birmingham
    - Daria Orlowska; Data Librarian and Assistant Professor; Western Michigan University

- **Open Qualitative Research**
    - Nathaniel Porter; Data Education Coordinator & Social Science Data Consultant, Assistant Professor; Virginia Tech

- **Reproducible Research Workflows**
    - Agata Bochynska; Researcher and Research Librarian; University of Oslo, Norway

These seven exceptional groups stood out from a highly competitive pool of applicants with their innovative proposals and dedication to advancing Open Science principles within the library community.

The winning groups will collaborate with the UCLA Library Data Science Center throughout the project to develop seven comprehensive course modules on various Open Science topics in 2023. These lessons will be designed for librarians at all career stages and suitable for in-person and virtual instruction settings. The goal is to create freely available and adaptable curricula that can be reused and remixed by the wider librarian community, ensuring a broad and lasting impact on Open Science education.

To assist the winning groups in their curriculum development journey, we will provide each group with a grant of $5,000 and technical workshops from July to October 2023. These workshops will follow the Carpentries Curriculum Development guidelines and the Collaborative Lesson Development Training program, enabling the participants to gain essential skills for effective lesson creation and delivery.

Congratulations once again to our winners, and we express our heartfelt gratitude to all the applicants who demonstrated their passion for Open Science and its transformative potential. The journey to enhancing librarian aptitudes in Open Science begins now, and we can't wait to see the impact these innovative lessons will have on librarians and researchers alike.

We encourage everyone interested in Open Science and the vital role librarians play in advancing its principles to stay connected with this project. As the winning groups embark on their curriculum development journey, there will be opportunities for feedback and engagement from the broader librarian community. By working together, we can collectively contribute to the advancement of Open Science and the promotion of knowledge sharing and collaboration in research.

Stay tuned for updates on the project's progress, and thank you for being a part of this exciting endeavor!
