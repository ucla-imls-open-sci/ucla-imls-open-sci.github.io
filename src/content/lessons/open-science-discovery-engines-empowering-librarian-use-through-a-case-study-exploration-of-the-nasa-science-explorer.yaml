  The module begins by describing how the Science Explorer (SciX) fits as part
  of the open science ecosystem and establishing how it supports the FAIR
  principles: Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable. You will be
  introduced to search features through examples highlighting the strengths of
  SciX for discipline-specific and interdisciplinary queries. You will also
  learn how to use SciX’s suite of second order operators to explore research
  trends and reviews, along with methods of finding similar papers and papers
  others studying the same topic have found useful. Lastly, you will learn how
  authors can claim papers within SciX with their ORCiD.
